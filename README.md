This is a custom forked repository.

Forked to support a project 'Vizall'. Additional styles should be forked from https://github.com/gravitystorm/openstreetmap-carto
The specific second style this repo adds, is: https://github.com/Jezternz/openstreetmap-carto-vizall-light

When started you can preview the styles with:
http://localhost/?style=osm
http://localhost/?style=vizall_light

Important:
This fork also sets CORS headers to the vizall domain, but these should be modified to your own domain (search for 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin').
